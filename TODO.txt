Remaining tests : commandHistoryAndCareTakerHaveDifferenteSizes.

Remaining problems :

- The originator should have a method to update its attributes.
- The originator should have a method to save memento into the caretaker.
- The originator should have a method to restoreFromMemento.
- The originator should not have getters.

- The care taker add(SelectionState) method is wrong, it should take a Memento as argument and not an Originator.
- The caretaker shoud have a getMemento(int index) method to return a Memento state save into its ArrayList.

- Memento design pattern violation : The invoker have an attributes of the class Originator. It should be the Originator which have an attributes of Engine !

-> states.add(new SelectionStateImpl(engine.getSelection().getBeginIndex(), engine.getSelection().getEndIndex()));

- Command design pattern violation -> The invoker have an attributes of the class Engine, which is also the receiver.

- Rename execute() to play() because execute() calling execute() is not clear enough
